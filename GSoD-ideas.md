# Ideas for Google Season of Docs projects

Interested in working with CHAOSS? 

Below are some project ideas. We describe how to apply to work with CHAOSS and how we select students on a different page: [GSoD-interest.md](./GSoD-interest.md).

**NOTE**: 
1. CHAOSS is participating in GSoD 2020 under The Linux Foundation, [Join CHAOSS for GSoD 2020](https://chaoss.community/blog-post/2020/06/09/google-summer-of-docs).
2. You can also find the ideas on The Linux Foundation wiki page, [GSoD 2020 CHAOSS wiki](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/2020-gsod-chaoss).
3. Know more about the working groups from here, [Participate, CHAOSS Community](https://chaoss.community/participate/).

## Write a conceptual overview of CHAOSS D&I metrics and refactor existing documentation

Work with CHAOSS D&I working group members to develop a conceptual framing for D&I metrics. The work so far has focused on defining individual metrics, resulting in much detail that is not uniformly presented. A technical writer can improve the information architecture, revise how a reader can drill down into the details, and make it easier to understand D&I metrics as a whole. The documentation would be collected in the CHAOSS D&I repository and could additionally be prepared for other dissemination forms to reach a wider audience. 

Knowledge/Skills Involved: Being a good human with good ethics. GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Workflow, HTML Inlines/Tables, Vector/Raster Images Requirements.

Aims of the project: Make the work of the CHAOSS D&I Working Group more available.

Mentors: [@GeorgLink](https://github.com/GeorgLink), [@germonprez](https://github.com/germonprez)

## Build documentation for D&I Badging project

The CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion Badging Program began as a way to ensure that D&I metrics can have a significant impact on the ways that communities function. The aim of the CHAOSS D&I Badging program is to bring D&I metrics into use for propelling good D&I practices in different open source systems.

This project will focus on framing documentation for the D&I Badging program and aligning it in such a way that it makes sense after translation. This work would focus on more community-facing docs related to Badging and also on existing Markdown files.

Knowledge/Skills Involved: Citizen of the world with editorial affinity across languages, GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Workflow, HTML Inlines/Tables, Vector/Raster Image Requirements.

Aims of the project: Write and structure D&I Badging documentation. Prepare documentation for easy translation.

## Expanding and restyling the GrimoireLab tutorial

GrimoireLab is a powerful open-source platform that provides support for monitoring and in-depth analysis of software projects. It produces a rich set of metrics with data extracted from more than 30 tools related to contributing to Open Source development such as version control systems, issue trackers and forums. These metrics are shown and exploited on Web dynamic dashboards, which can be easily inspected by decision-makers to help them understand the evolution and health of their projects.

The main entry point to learn about GrimoireLab is the tutorial [1], which provides a walkthrough of the platform and its components. Recently, the community has requested to revamp and expand its content to include additional information such as dashboard customization and management [2].

Knowledge/Skills Involved: Python, Jekyll, and Docker are suggested technology to know, but can be learned during the program.

Aims of the project:
  * Refactor the content of the tutorial with the TOC proposed in the issue [2] 
  * Revamp the content of the tutorial. Some content can be taken from [3-9]
  * Restyle the tutorial with a new template
  * Replace the current images with new ones. Some images can be taken from [9] 
  * Align the new content with the getting started guides available in the different GrimoireLab components

## Create a CHAOSS Community-wide Handbook

Work with CHAOSS members to develop a community handbook. Currently, working groups have developed their own ways of working and documented their disparate processes to varying degrees. The goal of the community handbook is to centralize critical information and standardize parts of it across the CHAOSS project. The handbook should serve as an instruction manual for existing and new community members on how to get work done in the CHAOSS project. This project involves a creative component of collecting and organizing content for the handbook as well as a technical component of defining how to represent the handbook.

Knowledge/Skills Involved: Being a good human with good ethics. GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Workflow, GitHub Pages, HTML Inlines/Tables, Vector/Raster Images Requirements.

Aims of the project: Create a Community Handbook for the CHAOSS project.

## Create a CHAOSS / Augur Developer Guide for Moving Data Exploration into New Metrics

Work with CHAOSS members, including Augur developers, to document how we move from exploration of Augur's schema with jupyter notebooks to the development of new Augur Endpoints, and new CHAOSS Metrics. Currently, the iterative process of metric definition and implementation occurs in an ad hoc manner. The goal of the community augur developer guide is to make the process of asking a question using Python or SQL, into formalized CHAOSS Metrics, and implemented Augur code. The guide should serve as an instruction manual for existing and new community members on how to answer the questions they have using Augur data, and then helping contribute to the Augur software and the CHAOSS project. This project involves a creative component of collecting and organizing content for the handbook as well as a technical component of defining how to represent the handbook.

Knowledge/Skills Involved: Being a good human with good ethics. Familiarity with RestructuredText, GitHub Pages, and image placement.

Aims of the project: Create an Exploration to Metrics Guide for the Augur and CHAOSS projects.

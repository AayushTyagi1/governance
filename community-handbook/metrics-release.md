# CHAOSS Metrics Release

## Regular Release

The regular release is when we update the version number and make a big announcement.

1. Coordinate between working groups that a new release is coming.
2. Each working group completes the “Continuous Metric Contribution” process for all of the metrics it wants to include in the release.
3. On a set date, all metrics that successfully completed the “Continuous Metric Contribution” process will be included in the next release.
4. Remove the “will be included in next release” statement on new metrics.
5. The release notes will be updated to state that all changes are part of the new release.
6. The release gets a new version number.
7. Produce a PDF of the released metrics for archiving the metric release version.

## Continuous Metric Contribution

The goal is to have short cycles of feedback and to get metrics out sooner.

1. Decide in a working group that a metric is ready for release.
2. Merge metric into the working group repository.
3. Include inside the metric that it will be included in next release.
4. Create an issue for collecting feedback before release.
5. Announce a 1-month feedback window on the mailing list and point to the issue.
6. Address feedback.
7. Update the website to include the new metric.
8. Update the release notes to indicate that we changed the release.
